Control Structures Color Game

main01--I believe it will prompt me the direct quote of 
"Greetings! What is my favorite color? " and not truly be able to decipher my answer.
My guess was correct.

main02--I believe it will allow me to prompt my favorite color.
My guess was correct.
It has prompted the same color that I submitted into the script.


main03--It will prompt me "Sorry, try again.")
My guess was correct.

main04--It will prompt me correct if I input red and sorry try again if not.
I tested this with red and purple and my guess was correct.

main05---It will prompt me correct if I input red and sorry try again if not.
I tested this with red and purple and my guess was correct.
I'm unsure how main05 is different than main04?

main06-- It will prompt me correct if I input red and sorry try again if not.
I tested this with red and purple and my guess was correct.
I'm unsure how main05 is different than main04 and main05?

main07--It will prompt me correct if red, close! if pink, sorry try again if not.
My guesses were correct!

main08-It will prompt me correct if red, close! if pink, sorry try again if not.
My guesses were correct! I'm unsure how main07 and main08 are different.

main09--It will prompt me correct if red, close! if pink, sorry try again if not.
Additionally it will prompt to guess it in multiple tries
My guess was not really correct...since it really hasn't done so since I guessed
multiple different times.

main10--It will prompt me correct if I guess any of the listed colors
but will also keep track of my times played and ask me if I want to  play again.
My guess was almost entirely correct. The Thanks for playing prompt only goes off
if you play multiple times? Additionally although it lists blue as a correct answer it
didn't accept blue? I believe this is because now it is a random choice that is correct?

main11--It will only prompt me if I guess the color.
I guessed it in 5 tries so I am correct.
